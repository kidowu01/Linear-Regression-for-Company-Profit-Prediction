# Linear-Regression-for-Company-Profit-Prediction

![](Image3.jpg)

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict company profits using multiple linear regression, based on features including R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. The pipeline preprocesses data from the 1000_Companies.csv dataset, visualizes feature correlations, and trains a model achieving an R-squared score of ~0.911, indicating excellent predictive accuracy. This project showcases expertise in data science, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling, making it a valuable portfolio piece for financial analytics and business intelligence applications.

## Key Features

•	Data Loading: Processes the 1000_Companies.csv dataset with financial metrics for companies.

•	Data Preprocessing: Encodes categorical State data (e.g., New York, California) using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder, avoiding the dummy variable trap.

•	Data Visualization: Generates a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features (e.g., R&D Spend and Profit).

•	Machine Learning: Trains a multiple linear regression model to predict profits, achieving R² = 0.911.

•	Model Evaluation: Computes coefficients, intercept, and R-squared score to assess model performance and feature impact.

•	Scalable Design: Adaptable to other financial datasets or regression-based forecasting tasks.


## Step-by-Step Workflow

**1.	Environment Setup:**

o	Installs pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

o	Imports libraries for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

**2.	Data Loading:**

o	Loads 1000_Companies.csv, containing columns: R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State, and Profit.

3.	**Data Preprocessing:**

o	Encodes State (categorical) using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder.

o	Removes one dummy variable to avoid multicollinearity (dummy variable trap).

o	Splits data into 80% training and 20% test sets with random_state=0.

4.	**Data Visualization:**

o	Creates a correlation heatmap using seaborn to analyze feature relationships.

5.	**Model Training:**

o	Trains a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression to predict Profit.

**6.	Model Evaluation:**

o	Predicts profits for the test set.

o	Computes model coefficients, intercept, and R-squared score.

o	Evaluates performance with R² = 0.911, indicating 91.1% variance explained.

7.	Results Storage (Optional):

o	Option to save predictions or visualizations (e.g., heatmap as heatmap.png) for reporting.

## Demo Results

The pipeline predicts company profits for the test set (200 samples). Below is a sample of predictions, with the full list available in the notebook:

| R&D Spend | Administration | Marketing Spend         | State      | Predicted Profit ($) | 
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| 165349.20 | 136897.80      | 471784.10               | New York   | 89790.62             |
| 162597.70 | 151377.59      | 443898.53               | California | 88427.07             |

| 100671.96 | 91790.61       | 249744.55               | California | 141396.22            |
| 100671.96 | 91790.61       | 249744.55               | California | 141396.22            |
| 93863.75  | 127320.38      | 249839.44               | Florida    | 109086.51            |


## **Full Test Set Predictions** (summarized; see notebook for complete list):

•	Predicted profits range from ~$50,194 to ~$293,584.

•	Example values: [89790.62, 88427.07, 94894.68, 175680.87, ..., 109086.51] (200 predictions total).

## **Model Performance:**

**•	R-squared Score:** 0.911, indicating the model explains 91.1% of the variance in profit.

**•	Coefficients:** [-880.54, -698.17, 0.53, 844.39, 0.11] (corresponding to dummy variables for State, R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend).

**o	Significance:** Coefficients quantify each feature’s impact on profit. For example, a $1 increase in R&D Spend increases profit by ~$844.39, while Administration has a negative impact (-$698.17), suggesting less contribution to profit. The strong positive coefficient for R&D Spend highlights its critical role in driving profitability, guiding businesses to prioritize R&D investment.

**•	Intercept:** -51035.23, representing the baseline profit when all features are zero.
